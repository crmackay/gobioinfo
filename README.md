# gobioinfo
my golang bioinformatics package

version 0.0.-1

**this is all experimental code** which is not all totally *idiomatic* go. I am learning as I go along, so take this as you will.

I would recommend the great [**Biogo**](http://github.com/biogo) if you are looking for a more mature bioinformatics package. (although they don't have a semiglobal alignment algorithm)

## Components so far:

- semiglobal alignment algorithm (and pairwise alignment struct)
- a FASTQ scanner structure for scanning a FASTQ file read by read

## To Be Added

- FASTQ writer
- better sequence structs
- probably SAM/BAM, and BED file io features
