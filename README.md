# gobioinfo
my golang bioinformatics package

version 0.0.-1

**this is all experimental code** it will break in the future so be forwarned...

## Components so far:

- semiglobal alignment algorithm (and pairwise alignment struct)
- a FASTQ scanner structure for scanning a FASTQ file read by read

## To Be Added

- FASTQ writer
- better sequence structs
- probably SAM/BAM, and BED file io features
